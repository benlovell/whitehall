# Whitehall Format migration specification

## content_id

Generated by and stored with the format in Whitehall.

Eg

```json
{ "content_id": "5eb731c7-7631-11e4-a3cb-005056011aef" }
```

## base_path

The format has a slug which is then used with URLMaker in Whitehall to create the base path.

Eg `"base_path": "/government/collections/national-driving-and-riding-standards"`

## description

Generated by and stored with the format in Whitehall.

Eg `"description": "The standards set out what it takes to be a safe and responsible driver and rider and provide training to drivers and riders."`

## public_updated_at

This is either the `public_timestamp` if the document has been published or `updated_at` if not. `CorporateInformationPage` weirdly have `public_timestamp` still set to nil despite having a `published` state.

Eg `"public_updated_at": "2016-02-29T09:24:10.000+00:00"`

## title

The title used for the main heading. Stored on the edition in Whitehall, either as `title` or `name`. `ComingSoon` pages all have the same hard coded title.

Eg `"title": "National standards for driving and riding",`

## updated_at

Generated by rails when the model is updated. This is not visible to end users in the frontend.

Eg `"updated_at": "2016-05-17T11:27:14.152Z"`

## schema_name

The schema to use for validating the format (see `govuk_content_schemas`).
It is also used to select the presenter and the template in `government_frontend`.

Eg `"schema_name": "document_collection"`

## document_type

The document_type is rendered above the title of the format. It is translated following the locale files.

Eg `"document_type": "document_collection"`

## format

**deprecated** 

## locale

Stored on the edition or set to `en` by default.

Eg `"locale": "en"`

## withdrawn_notice

Optional. Generated from the `Unpublishing` for withdrawn editions. This gets generated by the Publishing API when `/unpublish` is called with a request body that indicates the content item has been withdrawn.

## details

This contains the details for the content item. These differ by format and are defined by the schema.

## details.first_public_at

**Deprecated?**
